# Dockerized-Microservices-with-Apache-Kafka
Developed and deployed three microservices - Producer Service (Marketer), Consumer
Service (Customer), and Database Service (MYSQL) - NodeJS framework and Docker
containers. Enabled communication between the services using Apache Kafka messaging
system. Implemented CRUD operations to the database, created RESTful APIs for the services,
and used Kafka Producer and Consumer to send and receive messages between the services.
Tested the project using scripts and Docker-compose to ensure seamless integration. Final
output includes a set of Docker containers running the microservices and Apache Kafka
messaging system, demonstrating proficiency in designing and implementing scalable,
resilient, and fault-tolerant microservices architecture using modern technologies.
